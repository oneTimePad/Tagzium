The general idea:

"Tagger" is a placeholder for a real name.

The user creates something called an "Event", which is related to an actual event happening in their life, party...etc. The event generates a public album under their name. Any user can add photos or videos to the "Event". Each photo added can be tagged with users. Along with event is a collection of users tagged in all the photos. I.e., the whole event is one giant photo. By being tagged in a photo you have automatically joined the event. This forms what's called a "Tag Circle."(possibly tag videos too). By tagging, I literally mean a program runs that detects all faces and a user is associated with a face. In the tag circle, users who went to the event can go through the album seeing someone who was at the event with them who they'd like to chat with. You can initiate a chat with anyone in your tag circle.

In Facebook, albums are for a single person, they are not a public collage of images like this. Some problems are how would a user who doesn't have an account join the event...maybe a QR code to automatically generate an account for a given user and add them. To an event the user who generated the event can hang a QR code on the door in which each person scans it to join the online event.

That's the general gist...
